# Remote-Sensing-Image-Classification-Tool
Remote Sensing Image Classification Tool Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Implemented the algorithms of Machine Learning for Remote Sensing Image Classification using RNN (Recurrent Neural Network ).
GUI ( Graphical User Interface ) using Python facilitates to provide various information like input image, epoch, thresholding, training data, various layers of RNN, saving weights and Output.
It has been tested for different bands combination of multispectral images.
